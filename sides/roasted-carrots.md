# Roasted Carrots and Red Onions with Fennel and Mint

## Ingredients

- 2 pounds small carrots (about 2 bunches), peeled, cut into 3-inch pieces
- 2 large red onions, each cut through root end into 8 wedges
- 1 fennel bulb, cut into ½-inch wedges
- 4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
- 2 tablespoons raw sunflower seeds
- 1 teaspoon coriander seeds, coarsely chopped
- ½ teaspoon Aleppo pepper or a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes
- ½ teaspoon Hungarian hot paprika
- 2 tablespoons Sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons torn mint leaves

## Directions

Preheat  oven to 425°. Place carrots on a rimmed baking sheet and onions and
fennel on another rimmed baking sheet. (Make sure to give them plenty of  room,
which is key to roasted veggies with nicely browned edges.)  Drizzle vegetables
with 2 tbsp oil, dividing evenly; season with salt  and pepper. Roast, tossing
occasionally, until golden brown and tender,  20–25 minutes for carrots and
35–45 minutes for onions and fennel. Let  cool.

Meanwhile,  cook sunflower seeds, coriander seeds, Aleppo pepper, paprika, and
remaining 2 tbsp oil in a small skillet over medium heat, stirring  often,
until oil is gently bubbling around seeds and spices are fragrant  (be careful
not to burn), about 2 minutes. Let cool. Stir in vinegar  and lemon juice;
season vinaigrette with salt and pepper.

Combine  roasted carrots, fennel, and onions onto the same baking sheet,
drizzle  vinaigrette over, and toss to coat well; transfer to a platter.

Just  before serving, re-toss vegetables to pull up any dressing that may  have
settled at the bottom of the platter and scatter mint over top.
