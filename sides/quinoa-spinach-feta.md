# Quinoa with Spinach and Feta

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 4 large scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced
- 2 large garlic cloves, minced
- 8 ounces baby spinach leaves (8 cups), coarsely chopped
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1.75 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable stock
- 1 cup quinoa
- 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest (from 1 lemon)
- 0.75 cup crumbled feta (3 ounces), plus more for garnish
- 0.5 cup frozen peas, thawed (optional)
- 1 cup chopped fresh dill, or use parsley or cilantro

## Directions

1. Heat a 10-inch skillet over medium, then melt butter, 30 seconds to 1
   minute. Stir in about three-quarters of the scallions (saving some of the
   green parts for garnish) and garlic, and cook until softened, stirring
   frequently, about 3 minutes.

1. Stir in spinach, adding in batches if it doesn't all fit in the pan at once,
   and 0.5 teaspoon salt. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until spinach
   is wilted, about 5 minutes.

1. Stir in stock and bring to a simmer. Stir in quinoa, lemon zest and remaining
   0.5 teaspoon salt. Cover and simmer over medium-low heat until quinoa is nearly
   cooked through and most of the liquid is absorbed, 10 to 14 minutes,
   stirring once or twice.

1. Stir in cheese, peas (if you like) and dill, cover the pan, and cook for
   another 1 minute, to finish cooking and warm the peas. To serve, sprinkle
   with more cheese and the reserved scallions.
