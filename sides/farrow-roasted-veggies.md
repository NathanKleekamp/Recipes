# Farro Salad with Roasted Veggies

## Ingredients

- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1 cup semi-pearled farro
- 1 celery root, peeled and cut into 1-inch dice
- 3 carrots, peeled and cut into 1.5-inch batons
- 2 shallots, cut into Â½-inch dice
- 1 apple, cored and cut into 1-inch dice
- 1.5 cups sliced red cabbage
- 0.3 cup grapeseed or extra virgin olive oil, plus extra for drizzling
- 0.75 cup 0.5-inch-diced guanciale or thick-cut bacon
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 1 clove garlic, finely grated
- 0.5 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon honey

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Fill a medium pot with salted water and bring
   it to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, add farro and cook until tender,
   18-20 minutes. Drain, toss dry and set aside.

1. Meanwhile, place celery root, carrots, shallots, apple and cabbage on a
   baking sheet. Toss with oil and season with salt. Spread veggies on sheet in a
   single layer and roast on center rack until tender, stirring halfway through,
   about 25 minutes total.

1. In a small pan, cook guanciale over medium heat, stirring, until fat renders
   and lardons are firm but not crispy, 10 minutes total.

1. Make dressing: In a small bowl, combine red-wine vinegar, grated garlic,
   mustard and honey. Whisking continuously, slowly drizzle in olive oil until
   emulsified. Season with salt and set aside.

1. In a large bowl, combine cooked farro, roasted veggies and cooked guanciale.
   Toss well until combined. Season with salt and toss in enough dressing to slick
   the grains. Taste and add salt, pepper and additional dressing or oil to taste
