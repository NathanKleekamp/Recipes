# Sabanikh

## Ingredients

* 32oz spinach
* 1.5 lbs ground beef
* 1 large onion
* 1/2 tsp allspice
* 5 garlic cloves, medium to large
* Fresh cilantro, about a handful chopped with stems
* salt and pepper to taste
* garlic powder

## Directions

1. If frozen spinach, defrost in microwave. Squeeze out the water from the
   defrosted spinach. Tante uses a colander and potato masher, but you can also
   use your hands. Keep the spinach water.

1. Saut√© the onion until clear. Add the ground beef and cook. Season the ground
   beef with allspice, salt, pepper and garlic powder.

1. Add a generous amount of olive oil, maybe 1.5 tbsp to pot. Add the spinach
   to the heated oil. If you make a lot, cook it in batches. Cook until dark,
   but don't burn.

1. Add the ground beef and garlic. You may not need all the ground beef. Cook
   until garlic is fragrant. Throw in cilantro and add reserved spinach water.
   If you need more flavor, add about a 1/4 tsp of coriander.

1. Bring to boil, then simmer until done.
