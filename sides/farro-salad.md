# Mediterranean Farro Salad

## Ingredients

- 10 ounces farro (about 1.5 cups)
- 1.5 teaspoons kosher salt, plus 1/2 teaspoon
- 8 ounces green beans, cut into 1- to 2-inch pieces (about 2 cups)
- 0.5 cup pitted black olives
- 1 medium red pepper, cut into thin strips (about 4 ounces or 1 cup)
- 3 ounces Parmesan, crumbled (about 3/4 cup)
- 1 small bunch chives, snipped (about 1/4 cup)
- 0.25 cup sherry vinegar
- 0.25 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

1. In a medium saucepan, combine 4 cups of water with the farro. Bring to a
   boil over high heat. Cover and simmer over medium-low heat until the farro
   is almost tender, about 20 minutes. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons of the salt and
   simmer until the farro is tender, about 10 minutes longer. Drain well.
   Transfer to a large bowl and let cool.

1. Meanwhile, bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add
   the green beans and stir. Cook for 2 minutes. Transfer the cooked green
   beans to a bowl of ice water and let cool for 2 minutes. Drain the green
   beans.

1. Once the farro has cooled add the green beans, olives, red pepper, Parmesan,
   and chives. Stir to combine. In a small bowl mix together the sherry
   vinegar, olive oil, mustard, pepper, and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt.
   Stir to combine. Pour the sherry vinaigrette over the farro salad. Toss to
   combine and serve.
