# Mehshy Koosa bil Leban

## Ingredients

* 12 zucchini
* 1/2 lb ground beef
* 2/3 cup white rice, rinsed
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 2 lb yoghurt
* 1 tsp dried mint
* 1 1/2 tbsp corn starch
* Garlic, powdered or fresh to taste
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Olive oil

## Directions

1. Mix ground beef, rice, and half the onions together in a bowl. Salt, pepper
   and garlic to taste. Add water as necessary to form the meat.

1. Cut off top and core the zucchini. Before you start coring the zucchini,
   measure the corer against the zucchini to make sure you don't pierce the
   bottom. Reserve the cores.

1. Stuff the zucchini with the rice, meat and olive mixture. Tap the bottom of
   the zucchini on the counter to settle it. Leave 1 inch from the top empty so
   water can escape.

1. Put the cores and other half of the chopped onions in a pot with olive oil.
   Cook them until the onions are clear. Stack the stuffed zucchini on top of
   the onions and cores.

1. Fill the pot, between 1/3 and 1/2, with water. Add more salt, pepper,
   garlic, and the mint to pot. Rotate the pot to get some of the seasoned
   water into the zucchinis. If the zucchinis float, place a small, heavy plate
   on top. Bring the water to boil and then simmer soft about 30 min.

1. For the yoghurt sauce, dissolve the corn starch in about 1 cup of the cold
   yoghurt. Put the remaining yoghurt in a pot (whip it if it's lumpy). Mix in
   the yoghurt / corn starch mixture.

1. Heat the yoghurt sauce and let it thicken. Pour in the water from the pot
   with the stuffed zucchini. Add garlic, salt, and pepper. Add more mint, if
   necessary. Bring it to a boil on low heat.

1. Once the yoghurt sauce is seasoned well, pour it over the zucchini. Heat
   until warm.
