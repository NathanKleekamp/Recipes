# Pear Upside-Down Cake

## Ingredients

- 10 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus softened butter for
  greasing pan
- 0.5 cup packed dark brown sugar
- 4 small firm Bosc pears, peeled, halved and cored
- 1 cup all purpose flour
- 0.5 cup almond flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 0.5 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground cardamom
- 0.75 cup granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 large eggs, at room temperature
- 0.5 cup whole milk, at room temperature

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Coat a 9-inch round cake pan with softened
   butter. Melt 4 tablespoons of butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.
   Stir in brown sugar until dissolved. Pour mixture into bottom of the greased
   cake pan.
1. Arrange pear halves in cake pan in a starburst pattern, cored sides down. Set
   aside.
1. In a medium bowl, whisk together all-purpose flour, almond flour, baking
   powder, salt and ground cardamom, and set aside. Use an electric mixer fitted
   with paddle attachment to cream remaining butter and 2/3 cup sugar together
   at medium speed until white and fluffy, 3-4 minutes. Add eggs and vanilla
   extract, and beat until combined, scraping sides of bowl occasionally with
   a rubber spatula.
1. Reduce mixer speed to low. Add 1/3 of flour mixture and mix until combined.
   Add half the milk and mix until combined. Repeat with another 1/3 of flour
   mixture and remaining milk. Add final 1/3 of flour mixture and mix until
   batter is smooth and velvety.
1. Pour batter over pear halves in cake pan and spread in an even layer.
1. Bake until cake is golden brown on top and a cake tester inserted into center
   comes out clean, 40-50 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool on a wire rack,
   5 minutes. Place a serving plate on top of the cake pan. Slip an oven-mitted
   hand under pan and carefully invert warm cake onto plate. Serve warm or at
   room temperature. This cake is best the day it's made.
