# Brown Butter Cobbler

## Ingredients

- 3 cups fresh nectarines or peaches in 1/2-inch slices, or a combination about
  1 pound. Really any fruit
- 5 ounces sugar (about 3/4 cup)
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 3 ounces flour (about 3/4 cup)
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup buttermilk (or 0.5625 cups of yogurt with 0.1875 cup of almond milk.
  For 1 cup 3/4 yogurt and 1/4 cup almond milk)
- ¼ cup sliced almonds
- ¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
- 2 tablespoons Demerara sugar

## Directions

1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the
   fruit slices, 1/4 cup sugar and lemon juice. Stirring constantly, bring the
   mixture to a simmer, then take the pan off the heat.
1. In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and cook, swirling the
   pan occasionally, until it smells very nutty, turns golden, and flecks of
   dark brown appear, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the brown butter into an
   8-inch-by-8-inch baking dish.
1. In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, remaining 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder
   and salt. Pour the buttermilk into the dry ingredients and mix just until
   the dry ingredients are moistened. Scrape the batter on top of the brown
   butter, use a spatula to even out the batter but be careful not to mix it
   into the butter. Scatter the nectarine slices and juice on top of the batter
   without stirring. Sprinkle with the almonds, nutmeg and Demerara sugar. Bake
   until golden brown, 50 to 55 minutes. Transfer the pan to a wire rack to
   cool. Serve warm.
