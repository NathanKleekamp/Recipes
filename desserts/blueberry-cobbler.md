# Chez Panisseâ€™s Blueberry Cobbler

## Ingredients

The berries:

- 4.5 cups fresh blueberries
- 1/3 cup sugar
- 1 tbsp all-purpose flour
- 1 lemon, zested and juiced

The dough:

- 1.5 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 1.5 tbsp sugar
- 2.25 tsp baking powder
- 6 tbsp cold, unsalted butter cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 3/4 cups heavy cream

## Directions

- Heat the oven to 375 degrees. To prepare the berries,
  place in a bowl and toss with the sugar and flour.
  Set aside.
- To make the dough, mix the flour, salt, sugar and
  baking powder in a bowl. Cut in the butter until
  mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the cream and mix
  lightly, just until the dry ingredients are
  moistened.
- Put the blueberries in a 1 1/2-quart gratin or baking
  dish. Make patties out of the dough, 2 to 2 1/2
  inches in diameter and 1/2-inch thick. Arrange them
  over the top of the berries. Bake until the topping
  is brown and the juices bubble thickly around it,
  about 35 to 40 minutes.
- Let cool slightly. Serve warm with ice cream.
