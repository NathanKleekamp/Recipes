# Tofu Scramble

## Ingredients

### Scramble

- 8 ounces extra firm tofu
- Olive oil
- 1/4 red onion, thinly sliced
- 1/2 red pepper, thinly sliced
- 2 cups kale, loosely chopped

### Sauce

- 1/2 tsp sea salt
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp cumin powder
- 1/4 tsp chili powder
- 1/4 tsp turmeric (optional)

## Directions

1. Pat tofu dry and roll in a clean, absorbent towel with something heavy on
   top, such as a cast iron skillet, for 15 minutes.
1. While tofu is draining, prepare sauce by adding dry spices to a small bowl
   and adding enough water to make a pourable sauce. Set aside.
1. Prep veggies and warm a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add 1-2
   Tbsp olive oil and the onion and red pepper. Season with a pinch each salt
   and pepper and stir. Cook until softened - about 5 minutes.
1. Add kale, season with a bit more salt and pepper, and cover to steam for 2
   minutes.
1. In the meantime, unwrap tofu and use a fork to crumble into bite-sized
   pieces.
1. Use a spatula to move the veggies to one side of the pan and add tofu. Saut√©
   for 2 minutes, then add sauce, pouring it mostly over the tofu and a little
   over the veggies. Stir immediately, evenly distributing the sauce. Cook for
   another 5-7 minutes until tofu is slightly browned.
1. Serve immediately with the breakfast potatoes, toast or fruit. I like to add
   more flavor with salsa, hot sauce and/or fresh cilantro. Serves 2.
