# Frittata

## Ingredients

- 12 eggs
- 3 tablespoons full-fat dairy (heavy cream, half-and-half, whole milk, sour
  cream, crème fraîche or yogurt)
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup (4 ounces) grated or crumbled cheese
- 3 to 5 cups vegetables or greens of choice (or 3 cups leftover cooked
  vegetables or greens)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- Garnish: Chopped or torn fresh, leafy herbs (basil, parsley, cilantro, or dill)

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit for the traditional stove top
   method, or 350 degrees for the baked methods (casserole or mini/muffins).
1. Crack the eggs into a medium mixing bowl. Add your dairy of choice and the
   salt. Whisk just until the egg yolks and whites are blended. Whisk in all or
   half of the cheese (you can reserve the other half for topping the frittata
   before baking, if desired). Set the mixture aside.
1. Warm the olive oil in a 12″ cast iron skillet or oven-safe non-stick skillet
   until shimmering. Add the vegetables, starting with chopped onions or other
   dense vegetables. Cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally, then add
   any softer vegetables such as zucchini. Cook until those vegetables are
   tender, then add any garlic or greens, and cook until fragrant or wilted.
   Season with salt, to taste.
1. Traditional stove top option: Whisk the eggs once more and pour the mixture
   over the vegetables. Stir with a spatula briefly to combine and distribute
   the mixture evenly across the pan. If you reserved any cheese, sprinkle it
   on top of the frittata now.
1. Once the outside edge of the frittata turns lighter in color (about 30
   seconds to 1 minute), carefully transfer the frittata to the oven. Bake for
   7 to 14 minutes (keep an eye on it), until the eggs are puffed and appear
   cooked, and the center of the frittata jiggles just a bit when you give it a
   gentle shimmy. Remove the frittata from the oven and place it on a cooling
   rack to cool. Garnish with herbs, slice with a sharp knife, and serve.
1. Baked casserole option: Let the cooked vegetables cool for a few minutes,
   then stir them into the egg mixture. Grease a 9 by 13″ pan, then pour the
   mixture into the pan. If you reserved any cheese, sprinkle it on top of the
   frittata now.
1. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes (keep an eye on it), until the eggs are puffed and
   appear cooked, and the center of the frittata jiggles just a bit when you
   give it a gentle shimmy. Remove the frittata from the oven and place it on a
   cooling rack to cool. Garnish with herbs, slice with a sharp knife, and
   serve.
1. Baked mini frittata option: Let the cooked vegetables cool for a few
   minutes, then stir them into the egg mixture. Grease 18 muffin cups (I used
   two muffin pans for this), then fill the cups evenly with a scant ⅓ cup of
   the mixture. If you reserved any cheese, sprinkle it on top of the frittatas
   now.
1. Bake for 13 to 17 minutes, until the eggs are puffed and appear cooked, and
   the center of the frittatas jiggle just a bit when you give the pan a gentle
   shimmy (this happens quickly so keep an eye on them; my pan with only 6
   muffins finished sooner). Remove the pans from the oven and place them on a
   cooling rack to cool. Garnish with herbs, and serve.
