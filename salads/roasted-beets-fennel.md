# Roasted Beets with Warm Fennel Vinaigrette

## Ingredients

- 2 medium fennel bulbs (about 0.75 pound), quartered lengthwise, cored and
  very thinly sliced
- 3 medium beets (about 0.75 pound), peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
- 0.5 cup low-sodium chicken broth
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 0.5 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 0.5 bunch chives, chopped (about 0.25 cup chopped)

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Put the fennel in a medium bowl, cover
   with ice water and set aside.

1. Put the beets in a 3-quart casserole dish and toss with the chicken broth, 1
   tablespoon of the olive oil, 0.5 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper.
   Cover the dish with foil and bake for 45 minutes. Remove the foil; if there is
   0.25 inch or less of liquid, add 0.5 cup of warm water. Continue baking,
   uncovered, until the cooking liquid is reduced by half and the beets are
   fork-tender, 25 to 30 minutes.

1. Meanwhile, whisk the vinegar, butter, remaining 2 tablespoons oil and
   mustard in a measuring cup. Strain the fennel and toss with the vinegar mixture
   in a large bowl. Add the dressed fennel to the beets, toss with tongs and
   continue baking until the fennel is crisp-tender, about 15 minutes. Remove the
   dish from the oven, stir the beets and fennel to coat with the sauce and season
   with 0.25 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Transfer to a serving bowl
   and garnish with the chives.
