## Directions

### Pickled Red Onions

1. Place the sliced onion and garlic in a large heatproof jug or glass container.

1. Combine the vinegar, sugar and salt in a saucepan and bring to a simmer over
   medium heat, stirring regularly to dissolve the salt and sugar.

1. Pour the hot liquid over the onions and garlic and set aside to cool. Cover
   and refrigerate until ready to use. It will keep, refrigerated, for up to 1
   week.

### Roasted Shredded Hoisin Duck

1. Use your hands to pull the duck apart into smaller pieces. The breasts
   should lift easily off the rib cage. Remove and discard the skin, and
   working over a bowl, pull off and reserve all of the duck meat. Use 2 forks
   or your hands to pull the meat into smaller, bite-sized shredded pieces.

1. Pour 1 1/2 cups of the Hoisin marinade into the bowl containing the duck
   meat and stir until well combined. If you are not planning to make the salad
   right away, refrigerate the marinating meat until ready to use, up to 24
   hours ahead.

1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

1. Spread the marinated duck meat out on a large sheet tray (or cast iron
   skillet). Roast it for 10 minutes or until the duck pieces start to
   caramelize around the edges. Keep the meat warm while you start building the
   salad.
