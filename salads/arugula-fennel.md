# Arugula & Fennel Salad with Lemon Vinaigrette

## Ingredients

- 5 ounces (about 5 packed cups) arugula, washed and dried
- 1Â small fennel bulb, shaved on a mandoline or thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- Juice of one lemon (about 2 tablespoons)
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- Freshly ground pepper, to taste
- Pecorino, to serve

## Directions

Combine  the arugula and shaved fennel in a serving bowl. Combine the olive
oil,  lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, and a few grinds of pepper in a jam jar
or other small container with a lid. Shake the dressing until smooth and
cream. Dip a leaf of arugula into the dressing and taste; adjust any of  the
dressing ingredients to taste. Pour half the dressing over the  salad and toss
gently to combine. Add more dressing a little bit at a  time until you have
dressed the salad sufficiently to your liking.

Use a vegetable peeler to shave a few slices of pecorino over the top of the
salad. Serve immediately.
