## Ingredients

- 1.5 cups dried chickpeas, soaked overnight and drained
- .25 cups + 3 tbsp olive oil, plus more for serving
- 2 bay leaves
- 3x5-inch kombu
- 8 oz hearty rustic bread
- 1 cup chopped onion
- 6 garlic cloves, chopped
- 1 tbsp ground cumin, plus more for serving
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 2-3 tbsp harissa
- 3 tbsp fresh lemon juice
- 0.5 cup flat-leaf parsley leaves
- 1 tbsp grated lemon Zest
- 0.5 cup crunchy spiced roasted chickpeas for garnish

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.

1. Combine the chickpeas with 5 cups water, 1 tbsp of the olive oil, the bay
   leaves, and kombu in a Dutch oven or heavy stockpot over high heat. Bring to
   a boil, let boil for a few min, then reduce the  heat to low, cover, and
   cook until the chickpeas are tender, about 1 hr.

1. While the chickpeas are cooking, cut the bread into thick slices, then tear
   the slices into bite-size pieces. Place the bread in one layer on a large
   rimmed baking sheet and toast until crisp and lightly browned on top, about
   10 min. Remove from the oven and let cool in the pan.

1. Pour another 2 tbsp of the oil into a large skillet over medium-high heat.
   When it shimmers, stir in the onion and garlic and saute until tender and
   starting to brown, 6-8 min. Stir in 1 tbsp of the cumin, the salt, and
   tomato paste and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Turn off the heat.

1. When the chickpeas are tender, remove and discard the bay leaves and kombu.
   Use a slotted spoon to transfer 2 cups of the chickpeas to a blender and a
   measuring cup to transfer 0.5 cup of the chickpea cooking liquid to the
   blender. Add the remaining 0.25 cup of the olive oil and puree to combine.
   Return the puree to the soup and stir in the onion mixture from the skillet
   and as much of the pan juices as possible. If it seems too thick, add a
   little more water until it reaches your preferred consistency. Stir in 1
   tbsp of the harissa and the lemon juice. Taste and add more salt if desired.

1. To serve, divide the toasted bread pieces among soup bowls. Top each with a
   small dollop of harissa, then ladle in the soup. Garnish with parsley, lemon
   zest, and sprinkle of cumin, and roasted chickpeas. Serve hot.
