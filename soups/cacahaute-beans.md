# Lalo's Cacahuate Bean Soup

## Ingredients

- 1 onion
- 1 lb dried cranberry / borlotti (aka cacahuate beans), soaked overnight
- 2 garlic cloves
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 large tomatoes, chopped
- 2 dried ancho or guajillo chiles, stemmed, seeded, and cut into strips
- 1 tsp kosher salt

## Directions

1. Cut the onion in half. Keep one half intact and throw it into a large pot.
   Chop the other half and reserve.

1. Add the beans and 1 of the garlic cloves to the pot, along with enough water
   to cover the beans by 3 inches, and turn the heat to high. Bring to a boil,
   then reduce the heat as low as it will go, cover, and cook until the beans
   are tender, 60-90 min.

1. Chop the remaining garlic clove.

1. While the beans are cooking, make the sofrito. Pour the oil into a medium
   saute pan over medium heat. Add the reserved chopped onion and the chopped
   garlic and cook until the onion softens, about 5 min. Add the tomatoes and
   chiles and cook until the tomatoes break down, release their liquid and
   become very soft and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 10 min. Remove
   from the heat.

1. When the beans are tender, stir in the sofrito, increase the heat to high
   and cook, uncovered, until the beans are very soft and starting to break
   apart and the liquid has reduced by about 1/3 but the beans are still
   brothy, about 30 min.

1. When the beans are ready, divide them among shallow bowls and top each
   portion with pico de gallo. Serve hot with tortillas.
