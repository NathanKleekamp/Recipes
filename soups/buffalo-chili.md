# Buffalo Chili

## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons chili powder
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- Kosher salt and pepper
- 2 teaspoons ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 3 pounds tomatoes, cored and chopped
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 onions, chopped fine
- 1 red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 1/4 cup tomato paste
- 6 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 pounds ground bison
- 1 cup water, plus extra as needed
- 1 pound sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces

## Directions

1. Combine chili powder, cumin, 1 tablespoon salt, coriander, pepper flakes,
   oregano, and cayenne in bowl. Process tomatoes in food processor until
   smooth, about 30 seconds; set aside.
1. Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add onions and
   bell pepper and cook until softened, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in spice mixture,
   tomato paste, and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
1. Increase heat to medium-high, add half of ground bison, and cook, breaking
   up meat with wooden spoon, until no longer pink, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in
   processed tomatoes and water and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low,
   cover, and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour.
1. Stir in sweet potatoes. Pat remaining ground bison together into ball, then
   pinch off teaspoon-size pieces of meat and stir into chili. Cover and
   continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes and bison are
   tender, about 45 minutes. (If chili begins to stick to bottom of pot or
   looks too thick, stir in extra water as needed.) Season with salt and pepper
   to taste. Serve.
