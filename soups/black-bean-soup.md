# Black Bean Soup

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 medium yellow onions, chopped
- 3 celery ribs, finely chopped
- 1 large carrot, peeled and sliced into thin rounds
- 6 garlic cloves, pressed or minced
- 4 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (use 1/4 teaspoon if youâ€™re sensitive to spice)
- 4 cans (15 ounces each) black beans, rinsed and drained
- 4 cups (32 ounces) low-sodium vegetable broth
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro (optional)
- 1 to 2 teaspoons sherry vinegar, to taste, or 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
- Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- Optional garnishes: diced avocado, extra cilantro, thinly sliced radishes,
  tortilla chips

## Directions

1. Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or soup pot over medium heat until
   shimmering. Add the onions, celery and carrot and a light sprinkle of salt.
   Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetable are soft, about 10 to 15
   minutes.
1. Stir in the garlic, cumin and red pepper flakes and cook until fragrant,
   about 30 seconds. Pour in the beans and broth and bring to a simmer over
   medium-high heat. Cook, reducing heat as necessary to maintain a gentle
   simmer, until the broth is flavorful and the beans are very tender, about 30
   minutes.
1. Transfer about 4 cups of the soup to a stand blender, securely fasten the
   lid, and blend until smooth (never fill your blender past the maximum fill
   line, and beware the steam that escapes from the top of the blender, it's
   very hot). Or, use an immersion blender to blend a portion of the soup.
1. Return the pureed soup to the pot, stir in the cilantro, vinegar/lime juice
   and salt and pepper, to taste. Serve.
