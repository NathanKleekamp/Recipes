# Coconut Milk-Braised Shrimp & Winter Squash

## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon grapeseed or canola oil
- 1 medium yellow onion, minced
- 1 tablespoon minced ginger
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 1/2 serrano chile, seeded and minced
- 2 cups diced kabocha or peeled butternut squash, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 3/4 cups water, plus more as needed
- Kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar
- 1 (14-ounce) can coconut milk
- 1 teaspoon shrimp paste, optional
- 1 teaspoon fish sauce
- 1 pound shrimp, preferably head-on
- Steamed rice, for serving

## Directions

1. In a large, high-sided skillet, heat oil, onion, ginger, garlic and chile
   over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion turns
   translucent, about 5 minutes. Add squash, water, a pinch of salt, sugar,
   coconut milk, shrimp paste, if using, and fish sauce. Increase heat to
   medium-high and bring to a simmer.

1. Cook at a steady, gentle simmer until squash is fork-tender and sauce
   thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 15 minutes. Add shrimp
   and simmer until just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Serve over steamed
   rice.
