# Red Lentil Fuul

## Ingredients

### Cauliflower

- 1.5 lb cauliflower
- 2 tbsp sumac
- 0.5 kosher salt
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- Tahini (to serve)

### Soup

- 1 tbsp avocado oil
- 0.25 cup chopped white onions
- 1 garlic clove, chopped
- 0.25 cup chopped tomatoes
- 1 tbsp cumin
- 1 tsp ras el hanout
- 0.5 tsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 0.5 tsp fresh ground black pepper
- 1 cup red lentils
- 3 cups veggie broth
- 2 cups cooked chickpeas
- 2 tbsp butter
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 2 tbsp olive oil

## Directions

1. Roast cauliflower in cast iron.

1. To make the lentil fuul, pour the avocado oil into a Dutch oven or heavy
   stockpot over medium-high heat. When it shimmers, add the onion and garlic
   and saute until it starts to brown, 4-6 min. Stir in the tomatoes, cumin,
   ras el hanout, coriander, salt and pepper and cook until the tomatoes break
   down, 2-3 min.

1. Stir in the lentils and broth, bring to a boil, reduce the heat to
   medium-low and simmer until the lentils break down and become tender and the
   mixture becomes thick, 15-20 min. Stir in the chickpeas, butter, lemon
   juice, and olive oil and cook until the chickpeas are heated through, 2-3
   min. Taste and add more salt if needed. Turn off the heat and cover to keep
   warm.

1. To serve, divide the fuul among shallow serving bowls, top with the
   cauliflower, and drizzle with olive oil and tahini. Serve hot.
