- Hot sauce, like Sriracha (AKA rooster sauce)
- 1/2 cup roughly chopped peanuts, for garnish

1. In a medium Dutch oven or stock pot, bring the broth to a boil. Add the
   onion, ginger, garlic and salt. Cook on medium-low heat for 20 minutes.

1. In a medium-sized, heat-safe mixing bowl, combine the peanut butter and
   tomato paste, then transfer 1 to 2 cups of the hot stock to the bowl. Whisk

   the soup and mix well. Stir in the collard greens and season the soup with
   hot sauce to taste.
