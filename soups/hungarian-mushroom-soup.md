# Hungarian Mushroom Soup

## Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons of salted butter
- 1 1/2 cups white onions, chopped
- 1 lb mushrooms, sliced (use crimini, button, etc.)
- 2 teaspoons dried dill weed
- 1 teaspoon EACH: dried thyme AND dried mushroom powder (optional)
- 1 tablespoon EACH: sweet paprika AND lemon juice
- 2 cloves garlic, grated
- 2 1/2 cups low sodium chicken stock (or vegetable)
- 2 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 cup half and half (or whole milk)
- 1/3 cup room-temperature creme fraîche (or sour cream)
- 3 tablespoons chopped parsley

## Directions

1. SAUTÉ: In a dutch oven or soup pot, sauté the onions and mushrooms in the
   butter over medium heat for 5 minutes. Then, season with dill, thyme, and
   paprika and allow the mushrooms and onions to continue cooking for an
   additional 7-10 minutes, stirring often. Sprinkle the grated garlic and
   mushroom powder 30 seconds before the mushrooms are done.
1. WHISK: Then, slowly pour in the chicken stock, soy sauce, and lemon juice
   and scrape the bottom of the pot to loosen anything that might be stuck on.
   Allow the soup to gain a simmer and then let cook and reduce for 5 minutes.
   While the soup is reducing, whisk together the milk and flour in a small
   bowl until smooth (you can also just shake it all in a mason jar.) Then pour
   the mixture into the soup and continue to cook the soup for 8-10 minutes, or
   until the soup thickens, stirring as required.
1. FINISH: Remove the soup from heat. Stir the soup while you add in the
   sour cream slowly and allow for it to mix. Sprinkle with parsley to
   finish and serve warm with grilled bread rubbed with a clove of cut
   garlic!
