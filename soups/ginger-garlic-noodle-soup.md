1. Heat 1-2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium-sized stockpot over medium heat.

   4-5 minutes, or until the shallots turn translucent and start to soften.
   Stir often.

   part. Chop and set aside the green part for topping. Meanwhile, finely chop
   the white part of each green onion.
1. Add the white part of the green onions, minced garlic, and ginger to the
   shallots and mix. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 1-2 minutes or until
   garlic and ginger is fragrant.
1. Carefully pour the chicken stock or water (or mix) into the pot and bring to
   a simmer. To the pot add the star anise and soy sauce. Cover and continue to
   simmer for 10 minutes.
1. Remove lid from the pot and carefully remove and discard each star anise
   from the soup.
1. Add the sliced mushrooms, uncooked noodles, and bok choy to the pot and
   simmer for 5-8 minutes, or until noodles and bok choy are tender. Season to
   taste.
1. Divide soup between bowls and garnish with sesame seeds, the green parts of
   green onions and red pepper flakes (if desired).
