# Vegetable Soup with Fennel

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 3 carrots, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced crosswise
- 2 celery ribs, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced crosswise
- 2 leeks, white parts only, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced crosswise
- 1 fennel bulbâ€”halved, cored and thinly sliced
- 1 medium tomato, cut into 1/2-inch dice
- 2 bay leaves, preferably fresh
- 6 cups water
- One 3-inch square Parmigiano-Reggiano rind
- 1 tablespoon chopped flat-leaf parsley
- 1 tablespoon chopped basil
- Salt and freshly ground pepper
- 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

## Directions

1. Heat the olive oil in a large soup pot. Add the garlic and cook over
   moderate heat, stirring, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the carrots,
   celery, leeks and fennel and cook, stirring, until the vegetables begin to
   soften, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato and bay leaves and cook until the
   vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Add the water and the cheese rind
   and bring to a simmer. Cover partially and cook over moderately low heat
   until the vegetables are very tender, about 30 minutes.
1. Discard the cheese rind and bay leaves. Stir in the parsley and basil and
   season the soup with salt and pepper. Ladle into bowls, sprinkle with the
   grated cheese and serve.
