# Spring Detox

## Ingredients

- 2 tsp Dijon mustard
- 2 tbsp maple syrup
- 1 garlic clove
- 1/3 cup lemon juice
- 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1 cup olive oil
- 1 tsp sea salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper

## Directions

1. In a blender, combine the mustard, maple syrup, garlic, lemon juice, and
   vinegar. Process on medium-high speed until smooth and well combined, 5-6
   seconds.

1. With the blender running on low speed, slowly drizzle in the olive oil until
   the dressing is emulsified and thickened, about 30 seconds. Add the salt and
   pepper, adjusting the seasoning to taste. Transfer the dressing to an
   airtight container and refrigerate until ready to use.
