# Green Goddess

## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp coarsely chopped scallion, white part only
- 1/4 cup packed basil leaves
- 1/2 cup packed flat-leaf parsley leaves
- 1/4 cup loosely packed tarragon leaves
- 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 1/2 tsp sea salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper

## Directions

1. In a blender, combine the chopped scallion, basil, parsley, tarragon,
   vinegar, and mustard.

1. Process on medium-high speed until the herbs looked finely chopped and the
   ingredients are well combined, 15-20 seconds. Stop the blender and scrape
   down  the sides of the jar with a spatula as needed.

1. With the blender running on low speed, slowly drizzle in the olive oil until
   the dressing is emulsified and thickened, about 30 seconds. Add the salt and
   pepper, adjusting the seasoning to taste. Transfer the dressing to an
   airtight container and refrigerate until ready to use.
