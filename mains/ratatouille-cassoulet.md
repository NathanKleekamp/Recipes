# Ratatouille Cassoulet

## Ingredients

- 4 oz dried cannellini beans, soaked overnight
- 1 (28 oz) can crushed fire roasted tomatoes
- 1 eggplant, thinly sliced
- 1 zucchini, thinly sliced
- 1 yellow squash, thinly sliced
- 1 red pepper, thinly sliced
- 1 onion, chopped
- 5 garlic cloves
- 3 tbsp extra-virgin olive olive
- 3 tbsp za'atar
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- black pepper
- 0.5 cup bread crumbs

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

1. Pour 2 tbsp oil into a large, deep ovenproof skillet or flameproof casserole
   (with lid) over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic until tender.

1. Stir in the za'atar, salt, black pepper and cook until fragrant. Pour in the
   tomatoes and beans. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to boil. Turn off
   heat.

1. Starting at the outer edge of the skillet and working your way around,
   arrange alternating slices of the eggplant, zucchini, and squash (tightly
   overlapping them) on top of the tomato-bean mixture. Completely cover the
   mixture and arrange the red peppers on top.

1. Drizzle the remaining 1tbsp oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.

1. Cover and bake for 1 hour. The ratatouille will look soupy, and the beans
   won't be quite tender. Uncover it, sprinkle with bread crumbs, return to
   oven uncovered, and bake for another hour, until the bread crumbs are
   toasted, the liquid is thickly bubbling around the edges, and the beans on
   the bottom layer are very tender.

1. Let cool at least 15 minutes before service, with bread or a grain of your
   choice.
