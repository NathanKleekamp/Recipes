# Ragu Bolognese

## Ingredients

- 4 ounces pancetta, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 3 large garlic cloves
- 6 tbsp unsalted butter, divided
- 1 medium yellow onion (8 to 9 ounces), very finely chopped
- 1 medium carrot (4 to 5 ounces), very finely chopped
- 1 large or 2 smaller celery stalks with tender leaves, if any (about 3
  ounces), very finely chopped
- 1 pound ground beef (80/20, ideally grass-fed)
- 1 pound ground pork (ideally pasture-raised)
- 3 cups chicken broth or beef stock
- 1 cup dry white wine, such as Pinot Grigio
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 1 pinch grated nutmeg
- 1 cup whole milk
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 cup tomato puree or canned whole tomatoes and juices, passed through a food
  mill or pureed in a food processor or blender
- Freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

1. In a mini food processor, combine the pancetta and garlic, pulse a few times
   to break up the pieces, then process until it becomes a smooth paste.

   Scrape the paste into a large, wide Dutch oven or other heavy-bottomed pot,
   along with 2 tablespoons of the butter. Melt them together over medium heat,
   spreading the paste around with a wooden spoon so the pancetta fat begins to
   render. Cook until the fat is mostly rendered, about 4 minutes, stirring
   occasionally. Add the onion, carrot and celery — the soffritto — and cook
   slowly over medium-low heat, stirring frequently enough so the soffritto
   doesn't brown — until the onion is soft, translucent and pale gold, about 15
   minutes.

1. Add the ground beef and pork to the pot, increase the heat to medium, and
   break up the meat with a wooden spoon as much as possible. Once the meat
   starts to faintly sizzle, reduce the heat to medium-low. Let the meat brown
   slowly, stirring occasionally and continuing to break up any remaining
   clumps, for about 1 hour, until evenly browned and burnished.

1. When the meat is nearly done browning, in a medium saucepan over high heat,
   heat the broth until simmering; cover and keep hot over low heat until
   ready to use.

   Increase the heat under the browned meat to medium-high and stir in the
   wine, scraping up any browned bits or deposits on the bottom of the pan.
   Cook and stir until the wine is mostly soaked in and evaporated, about 3
   minutes. Stir in the salt and nutmeg, reduce the heat to medium-low and add
   the milk, cooking and stirring until it is barely visible, about 3 minutes.

1. Measure 2 cups of the hot broth and dissolve the tomato paste in it. Stir
   the broth with paste into the meat sauce, then stir in the tomato puree.
   (Keep the unused broth handy in the pot in case you need to reheat it and
   add more to the sauce later.) Partially cover the pot and let the sauce
   simmer slowly and gently, stirring occasionally, until it is thick and all
   the components begin to melt together, about 2 hours.

1. Stir the sauce — if it looks at all dry, reheat the remaining broth, ladle
   in a little more, about 1/2 cup, and stir. Continue to simmer gently,
   uncovered, stirring occasionally and adding a little more broth or water as
   needed to keep the sauce sumptuously saucy, until the vegetables have
   completely melted into the sauce, about 1 hour.

1. Cut the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter into a few pieces and stir them
   into the sauce; add about 20 grinds of black pepper and stir that in, too.
   Taste, and season with more salt and/or pepper, if desired.
