# Rack of Lamb

## Ingredients

- 1 (1 3‚ÅÑ4-lb.) Frenched rack of lamb
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tbsp roughly chopped fresh rosemary
- 1 tbsp chopped fresh thyme, plus 4 sprigs
- 10 cloves garlic, smashed

## Directions

1. Heat oven to 450 degrees. Season lamb with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a 12"
   cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add lamb fat side down and cook,
   using tongs to flip and sear the bottom and sides of the rack, until
   browned, about 10 minutes. Turn lamb fat side up in the skillet and scatter
   herbs over the top.

1. Reduce heat to 300 degrees. Add garlic to skillet and transfer to oven.
   Roast for 10 more min or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into
   center of the meat reads 130 degrees for medium rare. Let cool for 5 minutes
   before slicing into chops and serving.

## Notes

The "Reduce heat to 300 degrees" bit in step 2, was added from a different
recipe. It worked perfectly, though, so I added it to this recipe.
