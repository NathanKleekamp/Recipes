# Soy Sauce Chicken With Star Anise and Orange Peel

## Ingredients

- 5 tablespoons canola oil
- 4 bone-in, skin-on, chicken legs
- 0.75 cup soy sauce
- 0.5 cup rice vinegar
- 1 cup water
- 3 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 whole head garlic, halved crosswise
- Peel from 1 clementine or mandarin orange
- 3 whole star anise
- 1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
- 6 bay leaves
- 1 head cauliflower, broken into florets
- Salt
- 2 scallions, thinly sliced

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 475 degrees. Set a wide, heavy pot over medium-high heat and
   add 2 tablespoons canola oil. Add chicken legs, skin-side down, and sear until
   skin is golden brown, about 5 minutes. If necessary, sear in batches to avoid
   overcrowding the pot. Set seared chicken legs aside, skin-side up, on a plate.

1. As soon as the chicken is done searing, add soy sauce, vinegar, water, brown
   sugar, garlic, mandarin peel, star anise, peppercorns and bay leaves to the
   pot, and stir to combine. Return chicken legs to pot, skin-side up, and simmer
   over steady medium heat until sauce thickens and chicken becomes very tender,
   about 20 minutes.

1. Toss cauliflower florets with remaining canola oil and season with salt.
   Spread cauliflower across a roasting tray and bake until caramelized, 10-15
   minutes.

1. Let chicken rest in pot at least 10 minutes. Serve chicken with sauce
   spooned over top and roasted cauliflower and white rice alongside. Garnish with
   scallions.
