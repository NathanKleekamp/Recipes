# Baked Ziti with Roasted Vegetables

## Ingredients

### Vegetables

- 1 medium head of cauliflower, cut into bite-sized florets
- 1 red bell pepper, cut into 1″ squares
- 1 medium yellow onion, sliced into wedges about ½″ wide
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- ¼ teaspoon fine sea salt, divided

### Pasta and everything else

- 8 ounces ziti, rigatoni or penne pasta
- 4 cups (32 ounces) marinara sauce (homemade or store-bought), divided
- ¼ cup chopped fresh basil, plus extra for garnish
- 8 ounces (2 packed cups) grated part-skim mozzarella cheese, divided
- 2 cups (16 ounces) cottage cheese or ricotta cheese, divided

## Directions

1. To  roast the veggies: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit with
   racks in the middle and upper third of the oven. Line two large, rimmed
   baking sheets with parchment paper to prevent the vegetables from  sticking.
1. Place the cauliflower florets on one pan.  On the other pan, combine the
   bell peppers and onion. Drizzle half of  the olive oil over one pan, and the
   other half over the other pan.  Sprinkle the salt over the two pans. Gently
   toss until the vegetables on  each pan are lightly coated in oil.
1. Arrange the  vegetables in an even layer across each pan. Bake until the
   vegetables  are tender and caramelized on the edges, about 30 to 35 minutes,
   tossing  the veggies and swapping their rack positions halfway (lower rack
   to  upper rack, and vice versa). Leave the oven on at 425, because we’re
   going to bake the dish at the same temperature. If you end up with any
   stray burnt onion pieces, discard them, and set the vegetables aside.
1. Meanwhile,  bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Cook the pasta just
   until al dente, according to package directions (it will continue to cook
   while  it bakes in the oven, so you want the pasta to still have a little
   bite  to it). Drain and return the pasta to the pot.
1. Add 2 cups of the marinara, the chopped basil, and ½ cup of the mozzarella
   to the pasta. Gently stir to combine.
1. It's  assembly time! Spread 1 cup of additional marinara sauce inside a
   9×13″  baker. Top with half of the pasta mixture, and gently spread it into
   an  even layer. Evenly sprinkle the roasted cauliflower on top, then dollop
   1 cup of the cottage cheese over the cauliflower (it doesn't need to be
   spread into an even layer), followed by ½ cup of the mozzarella.
1. Top  the mozzarella with the remaining pasta. Then sprinkle the roasted
   peppers and onion on top, dollop the remaining cup of ricotta on top,  then
   dollop the remaining cup of marinara on that, then sprinkle the  remaining
   cheese all over.
1. Place a clean, rimmed baking  sheet on the lower oven rack to catch any
   drippings. Place the ziti,  uncovered, on top of the baking sheet. Bake for
   30 minutes, then  transfer to the upper rack for 2 to 5 more minutes until
   the cheese is  deeply golden, if desired.
1. Remove the baker from the  oven and let it cool for 10 minutes before
   serving (trust me). Sprinkle  freshly torn basil on top, slice with a sharp
   knife, and serve.
