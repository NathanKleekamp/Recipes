# Slow-Cooked Lamb with Moroccan Spices

## Ingredients

- 1 (5-6 pound) leg of lamb
- Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 3 tablespoons ras-el-hanout
- 1 tablespoon olive oil or grapeseed oil
- 2 yellow onions, roughly chopped
- 3 cups chicken broth, preferably homemade
- 5 cups butternut squash, cut into 1.5-inch cubes
- 1 cup golden raisins
- 1 cup slivered almonds
- Couscous, prepared

## Directions

1. Season lamb with salt, pepper and ras-el-hanout. Set aside at room temperature
   for 1 hour.

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Set a large oval Dutch oven or other ovenproof pot
   large enough to hold lamb over medium- high heat. Add oil. Once oil is hot, add
   lamb and brown it well all over, about 15 minutes total. Remove lamb and set
   aside. Add onions and cook until soft, 10 minutes. Increase heat to high and
   pour in broth to deglaze pot, using a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned
   bits from bottom. Bring to a boil and cook until liquid reduces by about a
   fourth, 5-7 minutes. Return lamb to pot and cover with lid. Bake 20 minutes.
   Reduce oven heat to 300 degrees and cook 2Â½ hours more. Remove lid and add
   squash. Return to oven and cook until squash is tender, 30 minutes. Add raisins
   and bake 5 minutes more.
1. Meanwhile toast almonds and prepare couscous according to package
   instructions.
1. Serve portions of lamb over couscous and sprinkled with toasted almonds in
   wide shallow bowls. Add a small ladle-full of broth to each serving.
