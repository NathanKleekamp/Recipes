# Boeuf Bourguignon

## Ingredients

- 2 pounds boneless beef shoulder or neck (chuck), cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 cup olive oil, divided
- 4 medium onions, halved and thinly sliced
- 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
- 1 cup red burgundy wine (such as pinot noir)
- 6 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 clove garlic
- 1 bouquet garni (a tied bundle of herbs, typically thyme, bay and parsley)
- Water
- Demi-glace (optional; see headnote)
- Chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, for garnish

## Directions

1. Thoroughly pat the meat dry with paper towels and generously season it with
   salt and pepper.

1. In a Dutch oven over high heat, heat half of the oil until shimmering.
   Working in several batches, and without moving the meat much, sear the meat
   on all sides until well browned, adding more oil as needed. (If you try to
   cook too much meat at once, it will steam and turn gray instead of brown.)
   Once the meat is well browned, transfer to a plate.

1. Reduce the heat to medium-high and add the onions and any remaining oil to
   the pot. Cook, stirring from time to time, until the onions have softened
   and turn golden, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle the flour on top and cook,
   stirring occasionally, until thickened, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the wine and,
   using a wooden spoon, stir, scraping up all the browned bits (fond) off the
   bottom of the pot.

1. Once the wine starts to boil, return the meat and its accumulated juices to
   the pot, and add the carrots, garlic and the bouquet garni. Add 1 1/2 cups
   of water (and about 2 tablespoons of demi-glace, if you have it). Bring to a
   boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, uncovered, until the meat
   is tender, 2 to 2 1/2 hours, skimming off any foam or oil that might
   accumulate on the surface. Check on the stew every 15 to 20 minutes,
   stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot to prevent scorching or
   sticking. As you check on the stew, continue adding 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup
   water, as needed, up to 2 1/2 to 3 cups total â€” to ensure there is enough
   liquid to cook down and concentrate. If the stew begins to stick, reduce the
   heat to low. The onions should fall apart, creating a thick, rich sauce that
   coats the meat.

1. When the stew is done, discard the bouquet garni, taste and season with more
   salt, if desired. Garnish with the chopped parsley and serve.
