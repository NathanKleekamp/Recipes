# Basic Roast Duck

## Ingredients

- 1 Whole duck
- Kosher salt and pepper, to taste

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
1. Lay the duck on a rack inside a roasting pan (or large cast iron skillet).
   Season generously with salt and pepper. Slow roast for 1 hour and 45 minutes.
1. Remove the duck from the oven and use the point of a sharp knife to prick
   holes in the skin surrounding the breasts and thighs. Return to the oven and
   cook for an additional 30 minutes, or until it reaches a meat thermometer
   reaches 135°F in the breast.
1. Carefully remove the roasting pan from the oven. Transfer the duck to a
   cutting board and let it rest for 10 minutes. During this time, the internal
   temperature will rise an additional 5-10 degrees. In the meantime, strain the
   hot fat and juices into a heatproof container. Let the juices cool
   completely and then transfer the fat to a different container and
   refrigerate.

### Notes

- For extra moisture, consider basting every 30-45 minutes with rendered fat
- Adding a small amount of liquid (stock, wine, or water) to the roasting pan can help prevent drying

#### Temperature Guidelines

- Target temperatures:
  - Breast: 135°F for medium-rare (pink center)
  - Breast: 140°F for medium
- Temperature checkpoints:
  - Pull duck from oven when breast reaches 135°F, as temperature will rise 5-10°F while resting
