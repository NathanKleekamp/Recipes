# Basic Roast Duck

## Ingredients

- 1 Whole duck
- Kosher salt and pepper, to taste

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

1. Lay the duck on a rack inside a roasting pan (or large cast iron skillet).
   Season generously with salt and pepper. Slow roast for 2 hours.

1. Remove the duck from the oven and use the point of a sharp knife to prick
   holes in the skin surrounding the breasts and thighs. Return to the oven and
   cook for another 1 hour and 15 minutes.

1. Carefully remove the roasting pan from the oven. Transfer the duck to a
   cutting board and let it rest for 30 minutes. In the meantime, strain the
   hot fat and juices into a heatproof container. Let the juices cool
   completely and then transfer the fat to a different container and
   refrigerate.
