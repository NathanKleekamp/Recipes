# Roasted Chicken with Figs and Rosemary

## Ingredients

- 4 ½ pounds bone-in chicken parts
- 1 tablespoon coarse kosher salt
- 2 rosemary sprigs, needles removed from stems (discard the stems)
- 2 garlic cloves, grated on a microplane or finely minced
- ½ teaspoon finely grated orange or lemon zest, plus optional orange or lemon
  wedges for serving
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- 1 pound ripe figs, stemmed and quartered lengthwise
- 1 to 2 jalapeño or red chili peppers, halved, seeded and thinly sliced
- Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, toss chicken with salt, rosemary, garlic, citrus zest and
   pepper. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to overnight (the
   longer the better).
1. Heat oven to 450 degrees. Spread chicken pieces out on two rimmed baking
   sheets, making sure there is plenty of room between the pieces. Arrange figs
   among the chicken pieces, then scatter jalapeño slices on top. Drizzle
   everything generously with olive oil.
1. Roast, switching the position of the baking pans after 15 minutes so
   everything browns evenly, until the chicken is golden and cooked through.
   This should take about 25 to 30 minutes for the breast meat, and 30 to 40
   for the dark meat. Serve chicken with the orange or lemon wedges for
   squeezing, if you like.
