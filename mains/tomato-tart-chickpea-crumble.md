# Tomato Tart with Chickpea Crumble

## Ingredients

- 1 (7 1/2-ounce) prepared pie crust or homemade pie dough, defrosted
- All-purpose flour (for surface)
- 1 cup cooked chickpeas, drained, rinsed, patted dry
- 4 tablespoons raw pistachios, coarsely chopped
- 2 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 small garlic clove, coarsely chopped
- 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 cup grated Parmesan, divided
- 2/3 cup Gruyère, divided
- 1/2 cup thinly sliced sweet onion, such as Vidalia
- 4 cups multicolored cherry tomatoes, halved
- 2 large egg, beaten to blend
- 1/2 cup basil leaves, coarsely chopped

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 450°F. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface to a 10
   1/2" round. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet and chill until ready
   to use.
1. Pulse chickpeas, pistachios, oil, garlic, lemon zest, salt, and pepper in a
   food processor until coarsely chopped, about 15 seconds.
1. Sprinkle half of cheese over top of dough, leaving a 1/2" border. Sprinkle
   three-quarters of chickpea crumble over cheese. Top with onion, then
   tomatoes. Top with remaining cheese and chickpea crumble. Fold edges of
   dough over filling, tucking and overlapping slightly as needed. Using a
   pastry brush, brush edges of crust with egg wash.
1. Bake tart until crust is golden brown and tomatoes are roasted and beginning
   to burst, 16–18 minutes.
1. Top tart with basil and cut into wedges.
