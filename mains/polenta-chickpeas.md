# Polenta with chickpeas and tomatoes

## Ingredients

- grits (prepared as instructed on package)
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 medium onion (about 7 ounces), diced
- 1 teaspoon fennel seeds
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon fine salt, plus more to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon finely ground black pepper, plus more to taste
- One (15.5-ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed, or 1 1/2 cups cooked chickpeas
- 1 (14.5-ounce) can diced fire-roasted tomatoes

## Directions

1. Make the chickpeas and tomatoes: In a medium skillet over medium heat, heat
   the oil until shimmering. Add the onion, fennel seeds, garlic powder, salt
   and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions start to
   soften and turn translucent, about five minutes.

1. Add the chickpeas and tomatoes, let it come to a simmer, and cook, stirring
   occasionally, until the liquid reduces and the flavors meld, 7 to 10
   minutes. Taste, and season with more salt and/or pepper, if needed.

1. To serve, divide the polenta among four bowls and top with the chickpea and
   tomato mixture.
