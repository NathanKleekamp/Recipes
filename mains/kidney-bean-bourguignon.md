# Kidney Bean & Mushroom Bourguignon

## Ingredients

- 1 lb cremini mushrooms
- 6 large shallots
- 2 carrots
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1.75 cups dark red wine
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 2 15-oz cans no-salt-added kidney beans
- 2 tsp fresh rosemary
- kosher salt
- black pepper
- 1 tbsp flour
- 2 tbsp butter

## Directions

1. Heat 1 tbsp butter in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms
   and cook, stirring occasionally, until they soften and exude their liquid
   and all but 0.5 cup of their liquid evaporates. Transfer mushrooms and their
   juices to a small bowl.

1. Add the remaining butter to the pan. Stir in the shallots and carrots. Cook
   until the carrots begin to soften and the shallots start to brown, 4-5
   minutes. Stir in the garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper. Cook until fragrant.
   Then sprinkle in the flour and stir to coat.

1. Pour in the wine and add the tomato paste. Cook until thick, 2-3 minutes.

1. Stir in the beans and the cooked mushrooms and cook until warmed through. If
   the sauce has thickened too much, stir in up to another 0.25 cup of the wine
   to keep it loose. Salt and pepper to taste.
