## Directions

Season chicken with 2 1/4 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. In a large
bowl, combine chicken, wine, bay leaf and thyme. Cover and refrigerate for at
least 2 hours or, even better, overnight.

In a large Dutch oven or a heavy-bottomed pot with a tight-fitting lid, cook
lardons over medium-low heat until fat has rendered, and lardons are golden and
crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer lardons to a
paper-towel-lined plate, leaving rendered fat in pot.

Remove chicken from wine, reserving the marinade. Pat chicken pieces with paper
towels until very dry. Heat lardon fat over medium heat until it's just about
to smoke. Working in batches if necessary, add chicken in a single layer and
cook until well browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side. (Add oil if the pot looks a
little dry.) Transfer chicken to a plate as it browns.

Add diced onion, carrot, half the mushrooms and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt
to pot. Cook until vegetables are lightly browned, about 8 minutes, stirring up
any brown bits from the pot, and adjusting heat if necessary to prevent
burning.

Stir in garlic and tomato paste and cook for 1 minute, then stir in flour and
cook for another minute. Remove from heat, push vegetables to one side of pot,
pour brandy into empty side, and ignite with a match. (If you’re too nervous to
ignite it, just cook brandy down for 1 minute.) Once the flame dies down, add
reserved marinade, bring to a boil, and reduce halfway (to 1 1/2 cups), about
12 minutes. Skim off any large pockets of foam that form on the surface.

Add chicken, any accumulated juices and half the cooked lardons to the pot.
Cover and simmer over low heat for 1 hour, turning halfway through. Uncover pot
and simmer for 15 minutes to thicken. Taste and add salt and pepper, if
necessary.

Meanwhile, melt 1 tablespoon butter and 2 tablespoons oil in a nonstick or
other large skillet over medium-high heat. Add pearl onions, a pinch of sugar
and salt to taste. Cover, reduce heat to low and cook for 15 minutes, shaking
skillet often to move onions around. Uncover, push onions to one side of
skillet, add remaining mushrooms, and raise heat to medium-high. Continue to
cook until browned, stirring mushrooms frequently, and gently tossing onions
occasionally, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove onions and mushrooms from skillet, and
wipe it out.

In same skillet, melt 2 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon oil over medium
heat until bubbling. Add bread and toast on all sides until golden, about 2
minutes per side. (Adjust heat if needed to prevent burning.) Remove from
skillet and sprinkle with salt.

To serve, dip croutons in wine sauce, then coat in parsley. Add pearl onions,
mushrooms and remaining half of the cooked lardons to the pot. Baste with wine
sauce, sprinkle with parsley and serve with croutons on top.
