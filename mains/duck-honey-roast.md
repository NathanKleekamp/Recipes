# Honey Roast Duck

## Ingredients

- 6 lb whole Pekin duck
- 2 lemon
- 5 garlic cloves
- 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar
- 4 tablespoons honey
- salt

## Directions

1. Set the duck on the working surface. Score the duck's skin on the breast
   in a diamond pattern, making sure you only cut the skin, without reaching
   the meat. Poke the other fatty parts of the duck with the tip of the knife
   all over, to ensure fat release, especially in very fatty parts. You don't
   need to poke the duck legs as the skin is pretty thin there (except for
   where the duck legs connect to the duck body). Season the duck very
   generously with salt both inside the cavity of the duck and outside on the
   skin, legs, all over. Place the duck breast side up.
1. Put 5 chopped garlic cloves and 1 sliced lemon inside the duck cavity
   (these are just for flavor, not for eating - you will discard them after
   cooking). The duck will have flapping skin on both ends - fold that skin
   inwards, to hold the garlic and lemon inside. Tie up the duck legs with
   butcher's twine.
1. Position oven rack in middle-lower third of oven. Preheat to 325°F. Place
   the bird breast side up on a large roasting pan with a rack (roasting pan
   should have a roasting rack to lift the duck from the bottom of the pan and
   allow the fat to drip below the duck). Roast the duck, breast side up, for
   45 minutes.
1. After 45 minutes of roasting, flip the duck on its breast and roast it
   breast side down for 30 minutes, maintaining temperature at 325°F. Check
   breast temperature at this point.
1. Flip the duck breast side up again on a rack in a roasting pan. In a small
   bowl, combine 1/2 cup of balsamic vinegar with the freshly squeezed juice of
   1 lemon. Brush all of the duck generously with the balsamic mixture
   (especially the scored duck breast) and cook for 30 minutes, brushing once
   more halfway through. Check temperature at 15 minutes.
1. In a separate small bowl, combine 3 tablespoons honey, 1 tablespoon water,
   and 3 tablespoons of the balsamic vinegar lemon mixture that you will have
   left over from the previous step. Brush the breast side of the duck
   thoroughly with this honey-balsamic mixture, and continue roasting at 325°F
   for about 30 minutes, brushing once more halfway through. Check temperature
   frequently during this phase.
1. Optional: If skin needs additional crisping and breast hasn't reached 135°F,
   increase temperature to 375°F for final 5 minutes. Watch carefully to
   prevent burning of the honey glaze.
1. Remove duck from oven when breast meat reaches 135°F (check in the thickest
   part of the breast). Let duck rest for 10minutes before carving. During
   this time, temperature will rise 5-10°F through carryover cooking.
   Carefully remove and discard the lemon from the cavity (being careful not
   to get burned). Carve and serve!

### Notes

- Use temperature readings as your primary guide, not time
- If any areas are browning too quickly, cover them with small pieces of foil
- Remove from packaging and let air dry in refrigerator for up to 12 hours
  before roasting for crispier skin

#### Temperature Guidelines

- Target temperatures:
  - Breast: 135°F for medium-rare (pink center)
  - Breast: 140°F for medium
- Temperature checkpoints:
  - Check every 15-20 minutes during glazing phases
  - Pull duck from oven when breast reaches 135°F, as temperature will rise 5-10°F while resting
