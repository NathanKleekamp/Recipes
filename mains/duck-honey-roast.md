# Honey Roast Duck

## Ingredients

- 6 lb whole Pekin duck
- 2 lemon
- 5 garlic cloves
- 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar
- 3 tablespoons honey
- 1 tablespoon water
- salt

## Directions

1. Set the duck on the working surface. Score the duck's skin on the breast
   in a diamond pattern, making sure you only cut the skin, without reaching
   the meat. Poke the other fatty parts of the duck with the tip of the knife
   all over, to ensure fat release, especially in very fatty parts. You don't
   need to poke the duck legs as the skin is pretty thin there (except for
   where the duck legs connect to the duck body). Season the duck very
   generously with salt both inside the cavity of the duck and outside on the
   skin, legs, all over. Place the duck breast side up.
1. Put 5 chopped garlic cloves and 1 sliced lemon inside the duck cavity
   (these are just for flavor, not for eating - you will discard them after
   cooking). The duck will have flapping skin on both ends - fold that skin
   inwards, to hold the garlic and lemon inside. Tie up the duck legs with
   butcher's twine.
1. Place the bird breast side up on a large roasting pan with a rack (roasting
   pan should have a roasting rack to lift the duck from the bottom of the pan
   and allow the fat to drip below the duck). Roast the duck, breast side up,
   for 1 hour at 350 F.
1. After 1 hour of roasting, flip the duck on its breast and roast it breast
   side down (roast the other side) for 40 minutes, at 350 F.
1. Remove the roasting pan with the duck from the oven (you now have roasted
   the duck for 1 hour + 40 minutes), carefully remove the duck to a platter
   (making sure the lemons and garlic from the cavity do not fall out - keep
   the skin on both ends of the duck folded), and carefully pour off all the
   duck fat juices from the roasting pan into a large heat-proof bowl or
   container.
1. Lower oven temperature to 335 F. Flip the duck breast side up again on a rack
   in a roasting pan (the pan will have no fat juices now). In a small bowl,
   combine 1/2 cup of balsamic vinegar with the freshly squeezed juice of 1
   lemon. Brush all of the duck generously with the balsamic mixture
   (especially the scored duck breast) and cook the duck breast side up for
   another 40 minutes, brushing twice more during this period (approximately
   every 15 minutes) with the mixture.
1. Now, in a separate small bowl, combine 3 tablespoons honey, 1 tablespoon
   water, and 3 tablespoons of the balsamic vinegar lemon mixture that you
   will have left over from the previous step. Brush the breast side of the
   duck thoroughly with this honey-balsamic mixture, and continue roasting at
   335 F for another 35 minutes, brushing the duck breast side every 15
   minutes with honey balsamic mixture (2-3 times total).
1. For the final 5-7 minutes, increase oven temperature to 375 F to achieve
   final crisping. Watch carefully and remove the duck if the skin reaches
   desired color before time is up. Internal temperature should reach
   135-140 F in the breast and 175-180 F in the legs.
1. After the duck is cooked, remove it from the oven, let duck stand for 15
   minutes. Then, carefully remove and discard the lemon from the cavity (being
   careful not to get burned). Carve the duck and serve!

## Notes

- TOTAL COOKING TIME: The duck should be roasted for a total of 3 hours. These
  3 hours of roasting are divided into 4 distinctive time chunks (1 hour breast
  side up at 350 F + 40 minutes breast side down at 350 F + 40 minutes breast side
  up at 335 F brushed with balsamic-lemon mixture + 40 minutes breast side up at
  335 F/375 F brushed with honey-balsamic mixture).
- Position the rack in the middle-lower third of the oven to prevent over-browning
- If any areas are browning too quickly, cover them with small pieces of foil
- Check internal temperature for doneness rather than relying solely on time
- Opening the oven less frequently helps maintain consistent temperature and
  prevents sugar burning from heating element temperature spikes
