# Honey Roast Duck

## Ingredients

- 6 lb whole Pekin duck
- 2 lemon
- 5 garlic cloves
- 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar
- 1/4 cup honey
- salt

## Directions

1. Set the duck on the working surface. Score the duck's skin on the breast
   in a diamond pattern, making sure you only cut the skin, without reaching
   the meat. Poke the other fatty parts of the duck with the tip of the knife
   all over, to ensure fat release, especially in very fatty parts. You don't
   need to poke the duck legs as the skin is pretty thin there (except for
   where the duck legs connect to the duck body). Season the duck very
   generously with salt both inside the cavity of the duck and outside on the
   skin, legs, all over. Place the duck breast side up.

1. Put 5 chopped garlic cloves and 1 sliced lemon inside the duck cavity
   (these are just for flavor, not for eating - you will discard them after
   cooking). The duck will have flapping skin on both ends - fold that skin
   inwards, to hold the garlic and lemon inside. Tie up the duck legs with
   butcher's twine.

1. Place the bird breast side up on a large roasting pan with a rack (roasting
   pan should have a roasting rack to lift the duck from the bottom of the pan
   and allow the fat to drip below the duck). Roast the duck, breast side up,
   for 1 hour at 350 F.

1. After 1 hour of roasting, flip the duck on its breast and roast it breast
   side down (roast the other side) for 40 minutes, at 350 F.

1. Remove the roasting pan with the duck from the oven (you now have roasted
   the duck for 1 hour + 40 minutes), carefully remove the duck to a platter
   (making sure the lemons and garlic from the cavity do not fall out - keep
   the skin on both ends of the duck folded), and carefully pour off all the
   duck fat juices from the roasting pan into a large heat-proof bowl or
   container.

1. Flip the duck breast side up again on a rack in a roasting pan (the pan will
   have no fat juices now). In a small bowl, combine 1/2 cup of balsamic
   vinegar with the freshly squeezed juice of 1 lemon. Brush all of the duck
   with the balsamic mixture (especially the scored duck breast) and cook the
   duck breast side up for another 40 minutes at 350 F, brushing every 10
   minutes with the mixture.

1. Now, in a separate small bowl, combine 1/4 cup honey and 3 tablespoons of
   balsamic vinegar lemon mixture that you will have left over from the
   previous step. Brush the breast side of the duck with this honey-balsamic
   mixture, and roast for another 40 minutes, brushing the duck breast side
   every 10 minutes with honey balsamic mixture. You can even carefully broil
   the duck for the last 10-15 minutes if you like (do it carefully, checking
   the duck regularly to make sure it doesn't char too much).

1. After the duck is cooked, remove it from the oven, let duck stand for 15
   minutes. Then, carefully remove and discard the lemon from the cavity (being
   careful not to get burned). Carve the duck and serve!

1. TOTAL COOKING TIME: The duck should be roasted for a total of 3 hours at 350
   F. These 3 hours of roasting are divided into 4 distinctive time chunks (1
   hour breast side up + 40 minutes breast side down + 40 minutes breast side
   up brushed with balsamic-lemon mixture + 40 minutes breast side up brushed
   with honey-balsamic mixture).
