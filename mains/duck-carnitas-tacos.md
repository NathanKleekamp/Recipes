# Duck Carnitas Tacos

## Ingredients

### Duck

- 4 duck legs (thigh and drumstick; about 3.5 lbs total)
- 6 tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 3 Tbsp. Morton kosher salt
- 1 lb lard or duck fat
- 4 Morita chiles, halved lengthwise
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 3-inch cinnamon stick
- 5 whole cloves
- 1 tbsp achiote (annatto) seeds
- 1 tbsp black peppercorns
- 1 tbsp dried oregano, preferably Mexican
- 1 large navel orange, quartered
- 1 head of garlic, halved crosswise

### Escabèche and assembly

- 1/3 cup fresh lime juice
- 1 tbsp honey
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 1 bunch radishes, trimmed, halved, thinly sliced
- 1/2 small white onion, thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup torn mint leaves
- 3 tbsp torn tarragon leaves
- 1–3 Fresno chiles, thinly sliced
- 12 6-inch-diameter flour tortillas, preferably Sonoran-style, warmed

## Directions

1. Prick skin on duck legs in several places with the tip of a paring knife.
   Rub legs with salt, working into flesh and skin. Transfer to a medium bowl
   or airtight container. Cover and chill at least 12 hours and up to 1 day.

1. Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 250°. Heat lard in a large
   saucepan over medium-high until an instant-read thermometer registers 250°.

1. Scatter chiles, bay leaf, cinnamon stick, cloves, achiote seeds,
   peppercorns, and oregano across the bottom of a large baking dish. Remove
   duck legs from bowl and brush off excess salt. Arrange legs, skin side down,
   over aromatics in baking dish. Nestle orange and garlic around legs, then
   pour warm lard over. Cover baking dish tightly with foil and bake legs 2
   hours.

1. Turn duck legs skin side up and nestle back into fat. Re-cover dish and
   continue to bake until meat is very tender and begins to pull away from the
   bones, 2–2½ hours longer.

1. Let duck legs sit in fat until cool enough to handle (30–40 minutes), then
   transfer to a plate. Reserve 3 tbsp fat for frying duck skin and strain
   remaining fat through a fine-mesh sieve into an airtight container and let
   cool. Cover and reserve for another use (see recipe intro for ideas!).

1. Remove skin from legs and set aside. Pull meat from bones, tearing into 1"
   pieces; discard bones and cartilage. Heat reserved 3 tbsp fat in a large
   nonstick skillet over medium and cook reserved duck skin, turning halfway
   through, until deep golden brown and crisp on both sides, 12–15 minutes
   total. Transfer chicharrones to paper towels to drain and let cool 5
   minutes; crumble into small pieces.

1. Do Ahead: Duck legs can be baked 3 weeks ahead. Transfer whole legs to a
   large nonreactive container; strain fat through a fine-mesh sieve over meat.
   Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before removing skin and
   shredding meat.  ESCABÈCHE AND ASSEMBLY

1. Whisk lime juice, honey, and salt in a medium bowl until salt and honey are
   dissolved. Add radishes, onion, mint, tarragon, and 1 chile and toss to
   coat. Add remaining chiles as desired (depending on their heat and how spicy
   you like things).

1. Top warm tortillas with some reserved meat, then radish escabèche and
   reserved chicharrones.
