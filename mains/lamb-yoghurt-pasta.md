# Macaroni with Yoghurt and Spicy Lamb

## Ingredients

### Pasta

- 2 cups Greek-style yoghurt
- 2 large egg yolks
- 1 1/2 tsp cornstarch
- 1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed
- 1 package spaghetti or similar

### Ground Lamb

- 1 large onion, peeled and roughly chopped
- 1 large carrot, peeled and roughly chopped
- 6 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped
- 5-6 tbsp parsley, roughly chopped
- 5-6 tbsp roughly chopped coriander
- Olive oil
- 3/4 tsp ground turmeric
- 1 tsp chilli flakes
- 1 tbsp cumin seeds, roughly crushed in a mortar
- Ground lamb
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- Pine nuts, well toasted (optional)
- Salt and black pepper

## Directions

1. Put the onion, carrot, garlic and half the herbs in a food processor and
   pulse until finely chopped but not pureed. Put four tablespoons of the oil
   in a large saute pan on a medium-high heat and, once hot, add the vegetables
   and cook, stirring occasionally, for 12 minutes, until softened and lightly
   browned. Add the spices, lamb mince, three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt
   and a generous grind of black pepper, and use a spoon to break apart the
   meat as much as possible. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 12 minutes, until
   the meat is nicely browned. Add the tomato, cook for five minutes more, then
   turn the heat to low to keep the mix warm.

1. For the pasta, put the yoghurt, egg yolks, cornflour, garlic, half a
   teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper in a large bowl and whisk to
   combine. Transfer to a large, nonstick saute pan and cook on a medium heat,
   stirring often, for 10 minutes, until the mixture is heated through and
   thickened.

1. While the yoghurt is cooking, boil the pasta in a medium saucepan of
   well-salted boiling water for about 13 minutes, until al dente. Drain the
   pasta, reserving some of its cooking water. Stir half the reserved pasta
   water into the lamb mixture, to loosen. Stir the cooked pasta and the rest
   of the reserved water into the yoghurt pan and cook on a medium heat for
   about two minutes, just to heat through.

1. Transfer half the yoghurty pasta to a large plate with a lip and top with
   half the lamb. Repeat with the remaining pasta and lamb, stirring the meat
   into the pasta in places. In a small bowl, combine the pine nuts, remaining
   herbs and last three tablespoons of oil, spoon this all over the top and
   serve warm.
