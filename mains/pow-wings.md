# POW! Wings with Yogurt-Mint Sauce

## Ingredients

### Chicken

- 3 tablespoons minced ginger
- 3 tablespoons minced garlic
- 1/3 cup chaat masala
- 1/2 tablespoon ground turmeric
- 1 tablespoon Indian red chile powder (optional if you want it less spicy)
- Zest and juice of 6 lemons
- 3 tablespoons neutral oil, such as grapeseed or sunflower
- 3 tablespoons kosher salt
- 2 pounds chicken wings
- Chopped cilantro, to garnish

### For the yogurt-mint sauce

- 2 cups fresh mint
- 2 cloves garlic
- 2 cups plain yogurt
- 1 tablespoon salt

## Directions

1. In a container with a tight fitting lid or in a large ziptop bag, combine
   all ingredients for the marinade and wings, and toss to make sure the wings
   are submerged in the mix. Let wings marinate in the refrigerator at least 12
   hours.

1. Make the yogurt mint sauce: Combine all ingredients in a blender and purée
   until smooth.

1. 30 minutes before cooking, remove wings from refrigerator. Preheat oven to
   375 degrees.

1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place a wire rack on top.
   Remove wings from marinade, shaking off any excess, and place wings on rack,
   making sure they do not touch.

1. Roast until wings are just about cooked through, 25-30 minutes. Increase
   heat to 425 degrees, and cook until wings are brown, about 10 minutes. You
   want to get a char, but not dry them out. Transfer to a platter and garnish
   with cilantro. Serve with yogurt-mint sauce.
