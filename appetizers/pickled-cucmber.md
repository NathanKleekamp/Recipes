# Pickled Cucumber

Makes 2 cups (about 8 portions)

## Ingredients

- 1 English cucumber, trimmed
- 0.25 cup diced red bell pepper
- 2 tablespoons seeded and diced jalape単o (1 small jalape単o)
- 0.5 cup white vinegar
- 0.5 cup granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon fine sea salt

## Directions

1. Slice the cucumber lengthwise. Cut each half into thin half-moon slices.
1. In a bowl, combine the cucumber, red pepper, and jalape単o.
1. In a small saucepan, combine the vinegar, sugar, and salt and bring to a
   boil over medium heat. Stir well to dissolve the sugar, about 30 seconds,
   then pour the hot liquid into the bowl with the cucumber, pepper, and
   jalape単o. Let sit until cool.

   use. The pickled cucumber will keep, refrigerated, up to 5 days.
