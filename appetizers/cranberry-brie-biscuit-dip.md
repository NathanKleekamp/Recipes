# Cranberry Brie Biscuit Dip

## Ingredients

### Brie

- 1 (12.3-oz) round brie cheese, at room temperature
- 1/4 cup cranberry sauce
- 1/4 cup shredded white cheddar
- 1 sprig rosemary
- Freshly cracked black pepper
- Drizzle of honey for garnish

### Biscuit

- 1 (16.3-oz) can refrigerated biscuits
- 2 tbsp butter, melted
- 1 tbsp freshly chopped parsley
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375°. Cut biscuits in half and roll into balls.
   In a small bowl, stir together melted butter and fresh parsley.
   Place biscuits in a ring around the edge of a medium skillet
   and brush with butter. Season with salt and pepper.
1. Place brie in the center of the biscuits and use a paring knife
