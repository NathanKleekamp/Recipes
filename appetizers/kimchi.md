# Citrus Kimchi

## Ingredients

- 1.25 pounds napa cabbage
- 0.33 cup minced chives
- 0.5 cup grapeseed oil or avocado oil
- 0.33 cup freshly squeezed lime juice
- 2 tablespoons agave syrup
- 2 tablespoons Sriracha sauce
- 2 teaspoons tamari
- 1.5 teaspoons fine sea salt
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes

## Directions

1. With a sharp knife, cut the cabbage leaves into small pieces, no larger than
   1 inch on a side. You should have about 5 cups of chopped cabbage. Transfer
   to a large bowl and add the chives.
1. In a small saucepan, combine the oil, lime juice, agave, Sriracha, tamari,
   salt, and red pepper flakes. Over medium heat, heat until almost boiling,
   stirring well to combine. Set aside to cool.
1. Pour the cooled marinade over the cabbage and chives and mix well. Transfer
   to a large glass jar or an airtight container and refrigerate for a minimum
   of 24 hours until ready to use.
1. The kimchi will keep, refrigerated, for up to 1 week.

Note: This makes a mild kimchi; if you like it more fiery, increase the red
pepper flakes to 2 teaspoons.
