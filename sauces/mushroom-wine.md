# Mushroom Wine Sauce

## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 16oz mushrooms, thickly sliced
- 1 small yellow onion, diced
- 4 cloves garlic
- 1 tbsp fresh thyme
- 1/2 cup Merlot or Cabernet Sauvignon wine
- 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream, sour cream, or yoghurt
- salt and pepper to taste

## Directions

1. Place a large heavy-bottomed pan over medium/high heat and melt in 2 Tbsp
   butter and 1 Tbsp oil. Add thickly sliced mushrooms and cook 5 min until
   soft. Stir in onion and cook another 3 minutes. Press in garlic cloves then
   season with 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper and 1 Tbsp fresh thyme. Cook
   another 2 min, stirring constantly until garlic is fragrant, then transfer
   mushroom mixture to a plate.

1. Cook your red meat in the same pan.

1. Add 1/2 cup wine and boil until reduced by half (3 min), scraping the
   bottom with a spatula to deglaze the pan. Add 1 1/2 cups broth and boil
   until about 2/3 cup liquid remains (5-6 min). Add 1/2 cup cream and simmer
   until sauce thickens slightly (2 min). Return mushrooms to the pan and heat
   until warmed through (1 - 2 min). Season sauce to taste with more salt &
   pepper if desired.
