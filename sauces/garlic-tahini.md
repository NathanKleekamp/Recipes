# Garlic Tahini Sauce

## Ingredients

- 1 garlic clove, cut in half
- 1/3 cup tahini
- 2-4 tbsp fresh lemon juice
- 1/3 cup water
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Directions

1. In a mortar and pestle mash the garlic clove to a
   pur√©e with a generous pinch of salt. Transfer to a
   bowl and whisk in the sesame tahini. Whisk in the
   lemon juice, beginning with the smaller amount. The
   mixture will stiffen up. Gradually whisk in up to 1/3
   cup water, until the sauce has the consistency of
   thick cream (or runny yogurt). Taste and adjust salt.
